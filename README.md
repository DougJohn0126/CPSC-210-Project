# My Switch Desktop Application

## Introduction
In March 2023, the Nintendo Switch will have its sixth anniversary. 
It's incredible to think that the adored console/handheld hybrid has been available for more than six years, 
selling more than 114 million devices, more than 900 million games, and providing countless unforgettable moments.
Nintendo puts an immense amount of money and time into producing titles that give its players the best experiences.
<br>

Despite this, the console/brand has fallen behind its social networking features, a tool that is very
integrated in today's society. The current app offered has very limited features and lacks appeal, when the whole 
point of it should be to enhance the users experience. There is currently no convenient way for one to share their 
Switch experiences with others.


## Project
<br>
The main goal of my project would be to create a desk top app that records and shares a user's experiences/records for
Nintendo Switch players to use. Considering how games have a handful of attributes and quirks for discussion, the 
list for features would go on and on. Some examples include:

1. Add a new game to library/backlog 
2. Add completed games to a list of completed games
3. Keep track of how many hours a user has played a game
4. See how many hours a specific game takes on average to finish
5. Total number of hours spent playing 
6. Total number of hours needed to clear/finish backlog 
7. Most played genres

Note that the examples 5-7 could only be made after the 1-4 is implemented carefully. Therefore, it will be 
crucial to plan out how those functions would work and the data is designed.
